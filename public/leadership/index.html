<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="🏛️ Strategic Governance &amp; Global Influence
I lead engineering organizations by bridging technical excellence with high-level business strategy. My leadership extends across regional boundaries to influence global engineering standards and organizational design.

India Engineering Council (IEC) Representative: I serve as the segment representative for a collective of 500&#43; engineering professionals, driving strategic alignment between regional talent and global product roadmaps.
Global Working Group &amp; Site Leadership: As a member of the Site Leadership team, I collaborate with stakeholders in the US, Canada, Finland, and New Zealand to operationalize global initiatives and standardize engineering practices.
Organizational Scaling &amp; Transformation: Successfully managed the transformation of the Chennai engineering hub from a 5-person unit to a multi-functional powerhouse, facilitating a broader 500% organizational scale-up.
Cross-Domain Leadership: I have successfully applied core leadership frameworks to drive results in both high-scale Telecom (Verizon - 11 years) and complex Applied AI,Transportation/Logistics &amp; Forestry (Trimble - 7 years) environments, proving that excellence is domain-agnostic.
Legacy of Transformation: During my tenure at Verizon, I managed large-scale engineering transitions that established the foundation for the organization-building expertise I now use to lead the India Engineering Council (IEC).

🚀 Building a High-Performance Culture
I believe that engineering output is a direct function of organizational culture. I spearheaded a segment-wide initiative to transition from task-based management to a high-impact, outcome-driven environment.">
