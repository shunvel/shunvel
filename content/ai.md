### The "Engineering to Order" (ETO) Model
I specialize in bridging the gap between bespoke quality and platform speed. By pioneering the **Engineering to Order** business model, I’ve turned custom-tailored software products into scalable, high-margin realities.

#### Agentic AI & Workflows
* **Beyond RAG:** Designing autonomous agents that move past simple chat interfaces to execute multi-step business workflows.
* **Modern Tech Stack:** Expert implementation of **LangGraph**, **N8N**, and Vector DBs to build self-correcting AI systems.
* **Agentic-Ready APIs:** Designing API ecosystems that are optimized for consumption by autonomous agents, ensuring future-proof platform scalability.
* **Autonomous Tuning:** Developed specialized agents for **SQL performance tuning**, identifying bottlenecks and suggesting index strategies autonomously.

### Cloud Governance & FinOps Excellence

I lead multi-cloud transformations (AWS, Azure, GCP) that support high-density AI workloads and distributed event-driven architectures.

* **97% AWS Cost Efficiency:** Optimized cloud resources to achieve a consistent **97% cost efficiency rating** through automated scheduling and instance rightsizing.
* **Automated FinOps:** Engineered an auto-shutdown framework for EC2 and RDS instances, resulting in direct annual savings of **$4k** and reducing manual patching effort by **1k hours**.
* **Serverless Optimization:** Reduced serverless deployment package sizes (Lambdas) by **97%**, significantly improving cold-start performance and operational cost.
* **Security Compliance:** Achieved 100% compliance in vulnerability management, reducing vulnerabilities from **150 to 15 per asset**.

### Engineering Excellence & Autonomous DevOps

**AI-Driven Quality Strategy:** Co-authored the **AI in QA Playbook**, establishing the organizational standards for integrating LLMs and Agentic workflows into the automated testing lifecycle.
* **Testing Pyramid:** Transitioned the organization from the "Ice Cream Cone" anti-pattern to a lean, AI-augmented **Testing Pyramid**.
* **QA Nexus Dashboard:** Engineered a unified automation testing dashboard using **ElasticSearch and Kibana**, providing real-time visibility into the health of **18+ major product releases**.
* **Mailbox Magician:** Built a unique tool that triggers end-to-end test suite automation directly via email inputs, bridging the gap between business requests and execution.
* **Unified Metrics:** Automated the tracking of **SPACE and DORA metrics** through a centralized DOMO dashboard to drive data-backed velocity improvements.

### The "Stay Curious" Tech Radar

For the **last 5 years**, I have spearheaded the development of our internal Tech Radar, providing a strategic technical North Star for the organization.

* **40% Adoption Rate:** Successfully achieved a **40% organizational adoption rate**, aligning engineering efforts with approved, forward-looking technology quadrants.
* **Active Technical Trials:** Governing the trial and assessment of high-impact technical projects, including:
    * **SQL Observability:** Implementing deep-dive monitoring for database interaction layers.
    * **Edge AI:** Exploring localized AI processing for forestry hardware and IoT devices.
    * **Modern Tooling:** Driving adoption of **Devbox**, **JMeter with AI**, and **Playwright MCP** to modernize the developer experience.
