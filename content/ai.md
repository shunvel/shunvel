### The "Engineering to Order" (ETO) Model
I specialize in bridging the gap between bespoke quality and platform speed. By pioneering the **Engineering to Order** business model, I’ve turned custom-tailored software products into scalable, high-margin realities.

#### Agentic AI & Workflows
* **Beyond RAG:** Designing autonomous agents that move past simple chat interfaces to execute multi-step business workflows.
* **Modern Tech Stack:** Expert implementation of **LangGraph**, **N8N**, and Vector DBs to build self-correcting AI systems.
* **Agentic-Ready APIs:** Designing API ecosystems that are optimized for consumption by autonomous agents, ensuring future-proof platform scalability.

#### Global Tech Leadership
Certifications in AWS (Solution Architect), Azure, and GCP allow me to lead multi-cloud transformations that support high-density AI workloads and distributed event-driven architectures.
