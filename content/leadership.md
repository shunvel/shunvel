### Architecture for Systems, Empathy for Teams
Technical excellence is only sustainable when paired with a high-performance culture. My leadership approach is built on three pillars:

#### 1. The Cultural Multiplier
I believe culture is the ultimate multiplier for technical output. By fostering an inclusive environment centered on accountability and career growth, I have maintained a **92% talent retention rate** even during hyper-growth periods of 500% expansion.

#### 2. Organizational Design as Architecture
I apply core software design principles—**SOLID, DRY, and KISS**—to organizational structures. 
* **Single-Threaded Ownership:** Reducing dependencies to increase velocity.
* **Lean Operations:** Eliminating "organizational debt" to ensure teams focus on high-ROI innovation.

#### 3. Strategic Mentorship
As a member of the Engineering Council, I drive org-wide technology adoption. I believe in mentoring the next generation of technical leaders, aligning their personal growth with the company’s strategic goals.
